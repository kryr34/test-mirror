# cbonsai

`cbonsai` is a bonsai tree generator, written in `C` using `ncurses`. It intelligently creates, colors, and positions a bonsai tree, and is entirely configurable via CLI options-- see [usage](#usage). There are 2 modes of operation: `static` (see finished bonsai tree), and `live` (see growth step-by-step).

`cbonsai` is always looking for ideas for improvement- feel free to open an issue if you've got an idea or a bug!

</a>

### Arch Linux (AUR)

Nicholas Boyd Isacsson has kindly packaged `cbonsai` in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cbonsai/).

### Debian-based

Robin Gustafsson has kindly packaged `cbonsai` as a `.deb` file over in [this repository](https://gitlab.com/rgson/debian_cbonsai/-/packages).

### MacOS

Follow the [Manual](#manual) installation, but if you install `ncurses` via homebrew, you may see this:

```
For pkg-config to find ncurses you may need to set:
  set -gx PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib/pkgconfig"
```

You may need to follow these instructions before running `make install`.

### Manual

You'll need to have a working `ncurses` library. If you're on a `Debian`-based system, you can install `ncurses` like so:

```bash
sudo apt install libncurses-dev
```

Or on Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel
```

Once dependencies are met, then install:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai
cd cbonsai

# install for this user
make install PREFIX=~/.local

# install for all users
sudo make install
```

## Usage

```
Usage: cbonsai [OPTION]...

cbonsai is a beautifully random bonsai tree generator.

Options:
  -l, --live             live mode: show each step of growth
  -t, --time=TIME        in live mode, wait TIME secs between
                           steps of growth (must be larger than 0) [default: 0.03]
  -i, --infinite         infinite mode: keep growing trees
  -w, --wait=TIME        in infinite mode, wait TIME between each tree
                           generation [default: 4.00]
  -S, --screensaver      screensaver mode; equivalent to -li and
                           quit on any keypress
  -m, --message=STR      attach message next to the tree
  -b, --base=INT         ascii-art plant base to use, 0 is none
  -c, --leaf=LIST        list of comma-delimited strings randomly chosen
                           for leaves
  -M, --multiplier=INT   branch multiplier; higher -> more
                           branching (0-20) [default: 5]
  -L, --life=INT         life; higher -> more growth (0-200) [default: 32]
  -p, --print            print tree to terminal when finished
  -s, --seed=INT         seed random number generator
  -v, --verbose          increase output verbosity
  -h, --help             show help
```

## Add to `.bashrc`

For a new bonsai tree every time you open a terminal, just add the following to the end of your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
cbonsai -p
```

Notice it uses the print mode, so that you can immediately start typing commands below the bonsai tree.

## How it Works

`cbonsai` starts by drawing the base onto the screen, which is basically just a static string of characters. To generate the actual tree, `cbonsai` uses a ~~bunch of if statements~~ homemade algorithm to decide how the tree should grow every step. Shoots to the left and right are generated as the main trunk grows. As any branch dies, it branches out into a bunch of leaves.

`cbonsai` has rules for which character and color it should use for each tiny branch piece, depending on things like what type of branch it is and what direction it's facing.

The algorithm is tweaked to look best at the default size, so larger sized trees may not be as bonsai-like.

## Inspiration

This project wouldn't be here if it weren't for its *roots*! `cbonsai` is a newer version of  [bonsai.sh](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/bonsai.sh), which was written in `bash` and was itself a port of [this bonsai tree generator](https://avelican.github.io/bonsai/) written in `javascript`.
